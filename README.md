# 24-2-birthday-reminders

Implement a simple program to calculate the next birthday.
At the beginning of the program, the user sequentially enters data on the birthdays of his friends: he enters the friend's name and the date of birth itself in full, including the month and year, in the format year/month/day. The end signal for entering birthdays is “end” entered as a name.
After that, the program calculates the nearest birthday in relation to the current time and displays it along with the name in a convenient, local format - month/day. If the birthday was already in this year, the user data is skipped. If one of the friends has a birthday today, then a special message about this is displayed in the console. Please note that there can be several such messages, because several people can have birthdays on the same day at once.
